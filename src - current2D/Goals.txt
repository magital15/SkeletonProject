Polynomial struct - stores mod base (0 if nothing specific) and array of coefficients, for now dense polynomial representation. Later we can create a sparse package

Arithmetic Package
reconstruct(int[] clues, int[] mods, int *output)
    // keep multiplying by primes until the result stops changing
add(pol1, pol2) // precondition: both polynomials have the same mod base
    sparse add joins two lists 
multiply(pol1, monomialPower) // pol * x^k
    output size = pol1.coef.length + monomialPower;
multiply(pol1, scalar)
    output size = pol1.coef.length;
polDense modPol(pol1, scalar)
    mod all coefficients of pol1 by scalar

// client methods
multiply(pol1, pol2)
    add all multiply(pol1, monomial of pol2)
subtract(pol1, pol2)
    pol2 = multiply(pol2, -1);
    output = add(pol1, pol2);
divide(pol1, pol2) // return remainder, once largest power of pol2 < pol1

2/18 Tali - code updates
A single value can now be reconstructed from two input arrays, a list of clues and a list of mods used for each clue. This is not yet run on the GPU.

struct polDense created - this structure needs to have functions including "modAllCoefficients" and a "copy all data from another polynomial". Discuss with a c++ expert the pluses and minuses of an array of structs vs a struct with an array - aka CONNER.
	Struct questions - can it have several constructors?
		how best to copy data from another structure?
		how to make sure sizes of arrays are the same?
		should the struct store a pointer to an array or the actual data?
	where should the struct be saved?

Worked on sanity check: get a polynomial, convert it to 2 distinct mod bases, reconstruct to get initial coefficients

2/20 Tali Cody - defining structs meetup
Vascillating between struct of structs and struct of modded arrays. Working on organizing header files with all helper methods AND rewriting methods onto GPU side. Working towards same sanity check.
TOP PRIORITY: Reconstruct(poly, *indexOfCoefficient)
THEN: Poly addition and multiplication

2/21 Cody - Restructure of the Project
We were in debate about how to structure the code and we have settled on using a PolyDense structure to contain the length, base, and coefficients of a certain polynomial. We will use a Poly structure to hold a number of PolyDense's so that we can easily access them and do modular arithmetic on them.
I have created a way to just change the number of primes we are using (in the kernel.h header file), so long as that number does not exceed the length of the primeArray in the section the primeArray is initialized. We should make that list of primes at least 20 places long to be safe.
I have initialized two Poly structures, a and b, to be test polynomials we can use to make our arithmetic work. Some of the functions I had in my mind are written out, and hopefully the code is clear enough to interpret. We need to add some of the functions in Tali's original code like the Chinese Remainder theorem, but this is a good skeleton for our skeleton project!

2/22 Cody - Changes to Src - Restructured
Added a feature in the getRemainder function to always get the positive mod of every number. This is UNINTUITIVE when taking a scalar multiple of a negative number, because members[1].coeffs through members[NUMPRIMES+1].coeffs are all positive. I believe when we do the chinese remainder theorem, it will give us all negative numbers in the members[0].coeffs. Something to keep in mind as we go forward.
Also, changed all references to length to go into the Poly structure, rather than the PolyDense structure. This will save loads of computation time!!! Great suggestion!

Things to do yet:
1. Implement multiplication
2. Implement Reconstruct (To get members[0] of our final output polynomial)
3. Work on getting the S polynomial

3/1 Cody - Update on current ordeals
1. We need to adjust these functions to be able to do arithmetic on different length polynomials. Example: a + b = c when a and b are different lengths. Question becomes, when b memory is allocated after its length, what values are we retrieving? If it is unknown, we need to check for the end of length b or a, whichever is shorter. Then, we need to make the arithmetic complete.
2. GCD extended is completely recursive, and we cannot do that on the gpu because each thread needs to know every step while it is calculating, and information being sent back and forth will be pretty difficult to manage. Unified memory will not ease this situation.
3. Multiplication with polynomial mods is the first instance where length is really, really important. Need to be careful with this.

Fixed Arithmetic with different lengths. For now just allocating memory to Polynomials A and B as a.length + b.length because the longest we'll need is a.length + b.length -1 for the multiplication polynomial.

Tried implementing a GCD extended to precalculate values for us on the cpu when the primes array is initialized. Found out there seems to be an error in the algorithm whenever we try to test integers > 7000. Try to figure out why, and correct the algorithm.

3/2 Cody - Encountering problems
Found out why the values over 7000 don't get found, and it is because some of the values in the intermediate calculations in the algorithm get much bigger than integers. I will try moving necessary values to double size.

I've created a way for double size multiplication that gives correct answers. For some reason there are values that cannot be found easily. You can try out the double version for yourself under src - double version.

Turns out these values are not being found probably because of b/a rounding off when it is converted to an integer and back. I'm pretty sure at least... I even went to do floor() and ceil() functions to try and get the double point precision to stay, but it did nothing to help the program. These functions are unreliable because rounding up values that are integer is not good, and rounding down negative integers is bad too. Lots of issues, emailing Storti now.

3/7 Tali Cody - Multiply is now working!
Next steps: S polynomial, and getting data transfer to mathematica
